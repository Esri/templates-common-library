## Steps for running tests
1. npm run build:run:test
2. Look at localhost:9000

Note: if there are random "Fatal" errors for Intern related to JS API types, you can just explicitly map the things that are failing from inside the intern.json file, and then the errors go away and the tests run. If the file is random, it's probably safe to assume that the remapping doesn't affect the test's validity.
